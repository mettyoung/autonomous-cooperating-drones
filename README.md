This is an application of RGBD-SLAM. We built another software stack on top of the [open-sourced RGBD SLAM algorithm](https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2)

Special thanks to Mr. Felix Endres for being patient in answering our queries to make the project feasible to complete.

We're uploading our thesis document to preserve a copy and as well as to share with the open sourced community.
